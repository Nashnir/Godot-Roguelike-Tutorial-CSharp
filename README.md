# Godot Roguelike Tutorial

_Yet Another Roguelike Tutorial in Godot_

Every year the subreddit _r/roguelikedev_ does the "_Complete Roguelike Tutorial_", an event where participants go through a tutorial together over the course of several weeks. The tutorial in question is the one for python and the tcod library, found at http://rogueliketutorials.com/

This year (2023) I am attempting to accompany that tutorial with my own tutorial series for Godot 4. This is an ongoing endeavour. By now I have fallen behind the reddit event. That event has concluded by now, but I will nonetheless try to this project (albeit at a slower pace).


 You can find the code for all the parts I have completed here.
